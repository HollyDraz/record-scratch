# Prime Solo Project Starting Repo
This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

We **STRONGLY** recommend following these instructions carefully. It's a lot, and will take some time to set up, but your life will be much easier this way in the long run.

## Use the Template for This Repository (Don't Clone)

- Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Use this Template` button, and make a copy to your personal account. Make the project `PUBLIC`!


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `prime_app` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `prime_app` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
